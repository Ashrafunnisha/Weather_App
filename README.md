# Weather Forecast Web App 🌤️

## Description  
A clean, web-based Weather Forecast application built with Flask (Python) + HTML/CSS/JS.  
Users can check current weather conditions (temperature, “feels like”, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and view a multi-day forecast. The UI updates with dynamic backgrounds and icons based on weather conditions and time of day.  
Your output may look similar to the screenshot below:
